      "description": "In order to facilitate the integration of AWS Bedrock with CodeMie for the purpose of utilizing Claude LLM models, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Create an AWS user or role** specifically designed for this integration. This user or role should have the necessary permissions to access AWS Bedrock services and Claude LLM models without compromising security.\n2. **Inject the credentials of this AWS user or role into CodeMie**. This will allow CodeMie to interact with AWS Bedrock seamlessly and utilize Claude LLM models for its operations.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- An AWS user or role with the required permissions for AWS Bedrock and Claude LLM models is successfully created.\n- The AWS user or role credentials are securely injected into CodeMie.\n- CodeMie is able to establish a connection with AWS Bedrock using the provided credentials.\n- CodeMie can successfully access and utilize Claude LLM models through AWS Bedrock.\n- Ensure all security best practices are followed during the integration process."

      "description": "We aim to integrate the ClaudeLarge Language Model (LLM) developed by Google into the CodeMie platform. Previous attempts to integrate LLM models through DIAL have proven ineffective, as DIAL lacks the necessary functions and tools for calling LLMs. Acceptance Criteria\r\n # *Integration Completion:* The Claude LLM Model from Google is fully integrated into the CodeMie platform.\r\n # *Functionality Testing:* Ensure that the integrated model can be called and utilized within CodeMie as expected.\r\n # *Performance Evaluation:* Assess the performance of the Claude model within CodeMie, ensuring it meets our standards for speed and accuracy.\r\n # *Documentation:* Update the CodeMie documentation to include details on how to utilize the newly integrated ClaudeLLM model.\r\n # *Error Handling:* Implement robust error handling to manage any potential issues arising from the integration process.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm if this meets your requirements so we can proceed to create the task in Jira."

      "description": "Add a detailed instruction to the assistant’s FAQ knowledge base describing how users can manage AWS Bedrock entities on the CodeMie platform, specifically referencing changes made in TICKNUM-7937 (Settings → AWS Integration).\r\n\r\nGeneral purpose and value for the user:\r\n- Provides a clear, step-by-step FAQ entry to empower users and reduce onboarding/support friction when handling AWS Bedrock entities through the platform\r\n- Enables the AI/Run assistant to deliver accurate, actionable advice for Bedrock integration and management scenarios\r\n\r\nPreconditions of use:\r\n- CodeMie platform is accessible to the user\r\n- AWS Bedrock account and required access credentials are available\r\n- Changes from TICKNUM-7937 are deployed to the platform\r\n\r\nScenarios of use:\r\n1. Create a valid AWS integration via Settings > AWS Integration (ensure the region field matches where the AWS Bedrock entities are created).\r\n2. Validate that access to AWS Bedrock is present.\r\n3. Create AWS Bedrock entity under the region selected in integration or locate pre-existing entities with 'Prepared' status.\r\n4. Log in to the CodeMie platform.\r\n5. Navigate to Profile → Settings → External vendor section.\r\n6. Observe entities.\r\n7. Import on the platform and verify that the 'Manage' button is active for entities created under the specified region.\r\n8. If needing to manage entities under a different region, change the AWS integration’s region configuration.\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n- Step-by-step guidance is included in the FAQ and available to users via the assistant, enabling seamless AWS Bedrock entity management through the CodeMie UI and integrations.\r\n\r\nAffected areas by this functionality:\r\n- FAQ Knowledge Base for assistant\r\n- User onboarding documentation\r\n- External vendor integration and AWS settings documentation\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n- FAQ entry added with clear, step-by-step process for managing AWS Bedrock entities in CodeMie settings.\r\n- Describes preconditions and region management caveats.\r\n- Linked to TICKNUM-7937 update.\r\n- Assistant is able to surface this guidance when asked about AWS Bedrock entity management or integration.\r\n- Content reviewed and validated by relevant SME/product owner.\r\n"
