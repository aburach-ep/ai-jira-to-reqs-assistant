*Background*

To reflect what identity is currently authenticated we show the assigned avatar picture in the masthead. Post UID removal as IDP, user will need to be able to assign avatars on different IDS identity linked to UID. This story is about introducing such ability in SAM. 

Note the existing UID Avatar is not affected, it's still fetched from the profile.sap.com and the related APIs - see [wiki|https://aDomain/wiki/display/ONEPROFILE/Avatar+API]

*Technical Details*
 * This story is about preparing the FE & UX part required for UIDX-4705

 

*Note -* we aim to replicate the functional behaviour that is present on profile.sap.com, please check out how it works there currently

 

*Acceptance Criteria*
 * IDS account avatars can be hidden via feature toggle 
 * -Upon selecting an identity in the Identity table, user can view the existing avatar in the details section on the right-
 ** -If no avatar has been uploaded for that identity, user see default picture. Note: profile service provides picture in all cases even default one.-
 * Upon clicking Edit Avatar icon, users can browse for new avatar picture and then upload it
 ** Supported file formats - JPG , (?) PNG
 ** File max size limitation
 * Delete option is supported
 * Option to resize and crop the picture on screen is supported (see profile.sap.com)
 * Show success message or error upon new avatar upload

Current intention is that SAP Profile APIs will be extended so that it can support IDS account avatars (to be done by the community team). SAM will consume those APIs so that users can maintain their IDS account avatars

*Technical Details*
 * Support community team with any UID/IDS related questions and design discussions
 * Investigate and document:
 ** Authentication approach for both scenarios 1) SAM to Avatar to Profile APIs and 2) Account Switcher to Profile APIs
 ** Generating a link on SAM side that navigate the user directly to Edit Profile Picture in profile.sap.com (UIDX-4958)
 ** Endpoints that need to be called from SAM to upload/edit/delete IDS account avatars (UIDX-4705)

To reflect what identity is currently authenticated we show the assigned avatar picture in the masthead. Post UID removal as IDP, user will need to be able to assign avatars on different IDS identity linked to UID. This story is about introducing such ability in SAM. 

 *Acceptance Criteria*
 * UID avatar - for now there will be no option to upload UID avatar in SAM but will provide an _Edit_ icon/button which will open [https://profile-qa.sap.com|https://profile-qa.sap.com/u/val_dinchev] in different tab. 
 * IDS account avatar
 ** Upon selecting an identity in the Identity table, user can view the existing avatar in the details section on the right
 *** If no avatar has been uploaded for that identity, user see default avatar 
 ** Upon clicking Edit Avatar icon, a popup/modal window opens where users can browse for new avatar picture (or drag and drop) and then upload it
 **  It's possible to delete an avatar from that window
 ** Show success message or error upon new avatar upload - ""Your avatar has been updated. Please note that it may take up to 30 minutes before your avatar is updated on all SAP systems.""
 ** Please check existing functionality on [https://profile-qa.sap.com|https://profile-qa.sap.com/u/val_dinchev]  Current understanding is that will re-use the existing backend from Profile application and we will only create a separate FE part on our side - but we should keep our UX as close as possible to theirs",,ARTDATA-5024,,,Internal,,Empty,,,,,,,,[],,Green,Yes,,CIM Iteration 25.2.2,,,,,,Maintain Status information,,,,Magenta,,"{""issueId"":23908494,""testStatuses"":[]}",,,,maintain in CAL Solution Editor

To reflect what identity is currently authenticated we show the assigned avatar picture in the masthead. To be bae to do so we need a functionality in SAM to assign avatar photos to linked identities.

*Acceptance Criteria*
 - Provide possibility for all linked user to set an avatar picture. That picture will be used to show the current chosen account in the header area.
 -- Align with Community team if we can re-use the avatar picker they already created for UID users.

 *Additional Information*
 - Community avatar picker: Authenticate to community.sap.com. Click in the avatar in the upper right corner which open a pop-up. On that pop-up click 'My Account'. Now your profile opens where you can choose/change your avatar picture.
 - Contact person for account picker is Alice Wonder.
 - Same functionality as we use already for UID avatars. That functionality is now enhanced to support as well IDS accounts
